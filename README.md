Pairing Heaps:

Pairing Heaps utilizes heap data structure to give efficient output by fast amortized time complexity.It is self adjusting,i.e. it can balance itself after an operation is performed.

Types:

Pairing Heap is of two types.
1- Minimium Pairing Heap.
2- Maximum Pairing Heap.

Minimum pairing heap is implemented here.

Advantages:

Time complexity for different operations is less in pairing heaps as compared to other heaps like Fibonacci Heap ar a simple Binary Heap.
Moreover,it is a an efficient form of a Fibonacci Heap.

Operations:

The operations of a min Pairing heap are:

1- Insert()

2- Merge()

3- FindMinimum()
